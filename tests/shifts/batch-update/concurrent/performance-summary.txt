Performance Summary - (/api/v1/shifts/batch/process):
Total Shifts Updated: 3,000
Total QStash Requests: 120
Batch Size: 25 shifts per QStash request

Duration:
    Start: 11:11:27
    End: 11:13:30
    Total: ~2 minutes

Processing Times:
    Average: ~1200ms
    Fastest: 803ms
    Slowest: 1935ms
    Normal Range: 1000-1800ms

Error Handling:
    - 1 failed request (500)
    - QStash auto-retry successful
    - Overall success rate: 100%

Observations:
    1. Stable processing times under concurrent load
    2. Effective queue management by QStash
