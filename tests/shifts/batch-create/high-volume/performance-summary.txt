        - Staggered Processing:
          * User 1: 4:32:12 - 4:32:47 (~35s)
          * User 2: 4:33:00 - 4:33:35 (~35s)
          * User 3: 4:34:40 - 4:35:14 (~34s)
        - System Throughput: ~171 shifts/second (all users)

    System Behavior:
        1. Queue Processing:
           - Sustained 5 req/s throughput
           - Consistent processing times
           - Very low CPU overhead
           - Efficient connection pooling

        2. Performance Patterns:
           - Predictable response times
           - No significant spikes
           - Stable under continuous load
           - Minimal resource consumption

    Key Findings:
        1. System handles sustained load effectively
        2. Processing times remain consistent
        3. Excellent resource efficiency
        4. Queue processing highly reliable
        5. Infrastructure well-sized for load

    Conclusions:
        1. System performs reliably at 5 req/s
        2. Can process 6000 shifts consistently
        3. Processing pipeline scales well
        4. Infrastructure has significant headroom
        5. Queue system effectively manages load
