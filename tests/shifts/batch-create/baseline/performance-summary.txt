    Processing Time Per 100 Shifts:
        Batch 1: 4.84s (cold start)
        Batch 2: 3.12s
        Batch 3: 3.76s
        Batch 4: 3.33s
        Batch 5: 3.87s
        Batch 6: 2.98s
        Batch 7: 3.05s
        Batch 8: 3.54s
        Batch 9: 3.63s
        Batch 10: 3.21s
        Average: 3.53s per 100 shifts

    Comparison to Single-Zone Baseline:
        1. Response Times:
           - Multi-zone avg: 3.53s per 100 shifts
           - Single-zone avg: 2.83s per 100 shifts
           - ~25% increase in processing time
        
        2. Consistency:
           - Higher standard deviation (669ms vs 424ms)
           - More variation in processing times
           - Wider range of response times

        3. Cold Start Impact:
           - Multiple cold starts across regions
           - First batch takes longer (4.84s vs 4.27s)

    Processing Patterns:
        1. Initial Phase (14:40:27 - 14:40:32):
           - Longer durations (1.4-2.5s)
           - Cold start effects visible

        2. Mid Processing (14:40:32 - 14:40:45):
           - Mix of fast and medium durations
           - Good parallelism observed

        3. Final Phase (14:40:45 - 14:40:52):
           - Consistent medium-range durations
           - Some slower responses (2s+)

    Key Findings:
        1. Multi-zone deployment adds ~0.7s average overhead
        2. Higher variation in response times
        3. QStash parallelism still effective
        4. System remains stable across regions
        5. No failures despite geographic distribution
        6. Performance still within acceptable thresholds

    Recommendations:
        1. Consider region-specific performance tuning
        2. Monitor cold starts across regions
        3. Current thresholds appropriate for multi-zone
        4. Keep parallelism at 3 for optimal performance
