Request Statistics:
    - Total Requests: 152 (38 batches × 4 QStash requests)
    - Batch Size: 25 shifts per QStash request
    - Total Shifts Processed: 3,800 shifts
    - Success Rate: 100% (all 200 OK)
    - Processing Period: 12:58:35 - 12:59:34 (~59 seconds)
    
Processing Times:
    - Average Duration: ~255ms
    - Minimum Duration: 212ms
    - Maximum Duration: 314ms
    - Standard Deviation: ~23ms
    - Distribution:
        * Fast (212-240ms): ~25%
        * Medium (241-270ms): ~50%
        * Slower (271-314ms): ~25%

Throughput Analysis:
